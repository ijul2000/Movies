Anyone gets curious,
move them along.

We don't want her
drawing a crowd.

[Stubb] Inspector Rees?

8
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:52,413
Yes?

9
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:53,713
Sebastian Stubb, of
the London Morning Times.

10
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:55,183
Ah, yes, of course.

11
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,617
Anything you can
share with our readers

12
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,818
about the incident?

13
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,788
I doubt your readers would
be very interested, Mr.Stubb.

14
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:03,390
Oh well, with all
due respect sir,

15
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:05,126
I think I'll be
the judge of that.

16
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,627
Lone woman.

17
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,462
Knife wound.

18
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:12,633
Probably a robbery gone
awry some time in the night.

19
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:13,667
Dear, oh dear,
oh dear Inspector,

20
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,471
you'll never make a
headline writer will you?

21
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,840
What about "mysterious assailant

22
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:24,078
slashes wench-woman's throat
in bloody midnight attack".

23
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,613
That's conjecture.

24
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:29,382
Time of death is yet
to be established.

25
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:31,118
All right.

26
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:34,654
What about "bloody
night time attack" then?

27
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,190
It's reasonable enough.

28
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,159
Now I really must be going.

29
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:41,895
Oh, can I quote you Inspector?

30
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:43,631
If you must.

[suspenseful music]

32
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:53,340
Who told you her
throat was slashed?

33
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,679
Well, it always
pays to be early

34
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:00,247
on the scene, Inspector.

35

Morning, Mr Locque.

39
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:52,832
Inspector Rees sends
his regards, sir.

40
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:53,700
What else?

41
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:55,869
Oh, it's a young woman.

42
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:58,840
Found down the dark end of a
dark alley in the early hours.

43
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:01,942
No prizes for guessing what
she was up to down there.

44
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:04,579
Well, we'll find
out shortly, won't we?

45
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,449
There's always a
trace left behind.

46
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:09,450
Well, that depends,

47
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:12,687
on whether she swallowed
or spat, doesn't it?

48
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:16,257
There is always a trace, Dodd.

49
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:18,692
You would do well
to remember that.

50
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,629
What are they saying
is the cause of death?

51
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:24,331
Cut throat, sir.

52
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,199
Have a look.

53
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:39,346
Now, he was saying, it looked
like some fellow had got

54
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,281
what he wanted but
didn't wanna pay.

55
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:44,618
He probably had a
penknife in his pocket,

56
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,487
there was a scuffle, and
he, er, let her have it.

57
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:50,891
What?

58
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:53,627
The penknife.

59
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:54,461
In the throat, like.

60
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,665
It's a very sharp
penknife if it was.

61
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,401
Yeah well, they
are, aren't they?

62
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:01,302
Not usually.

63
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:04,538
Not this sharp.

64
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:08,308
If a man carries a penknife

65
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:13,347
he uses it for all sorts
of tasks, sawing rope,

66
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,682
digging stones from
horses' hooves, anything.

67
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:19,787
The blade ends up
damaged and blunt,

68
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:23,024
with the result being that
penknife cuts are usually jagged,

69
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:26,760
with lots of damage to
the surrounding skin.

70
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:30,898
This one is very clean, it's
made with a good quality blade.

71
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,768
A knife's a knife.

72
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,435
I'm trying to teach
you something here, Dodd.

73
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,040
It would be good if you
could show some ambition

74
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:41,609
to better yourself.

75
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,310
You don't wanna be pushing
cadavers round in here

76
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:44,444
all your life.

77
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:46,079
No, sir.

78
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:48,048
But I don't wanna be
slicing them up, neither.

79
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,317
Wait!

80
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,923
Death by cut
throat, did you say?

81
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:57,325
That's what he said, sir.

82
00:06:58,091 --> 00:06:59,326
Then what is that?

83
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,466
Jesus Christ!

84
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,838
Well I shall
tell you one thing,

85
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:19,413
this was no scuffle over a coin.

what are you after?

89
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,668
A quick word with
the lady of the house,

90
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:41,635
if you'd be so kind.

91
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:43,370
[Sally] Miss Levine?

92
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:44,105
If you'd be so kind.

93
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:45,605
Well, I'll ask her-

94
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,408
- Tell her it's Ins,

95
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,478
Tell her it's Edmund Rees.

[door opening]
[tea burbling]

98
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:05,460
Some tea, Inspector?

99
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:08,395
That would be very nice.

100
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:11,031
[tea burbling]

101
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:19,039
It's been a long time

102
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,908
since you've darkened
my doorstep, Edmund.

103
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:24,145
You have a knack of
making every phrase

104
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:26,079
sound like a
euphemism, Miss Levine.

105
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:28,449
What, "darkened my doorstep"?

106
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:30,684
Never heard it called that.

107
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:33,187
I've heard it called a lot of
things but that's a new one.

108
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,523
Can you guess what
brought me here today?

109
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:38,926
Yes, I can guess.

110
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,495
So you know what
I'm going to ask?

111
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:45,665
That girl they
found in the night.

112
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,534
Not far from here wasn't it?

113
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:48,502
Two streets down.

114
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,038
It's getting more dangerous
by the hour out there.

115
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,073
Can't you do something about it?

116
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:54,975
Do you know who she was?

117
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,143
I do.

118
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:58,512
One of the girls from here
was the one that found her.

119
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,814
Came running back and
told me all about it.

120
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:02,416
I'd like to speak to her.

121
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,751
I don't think she'd
like to speak to you.

122
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:06,519
You wouldn't have got
past the door if Sally

123
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:07,455
had known who you were.

124
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:09,123
Did she recognize the victim?

125
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:10,524
Yes.

126
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:14,495
Polly Neilson was
her name, I knew her.

127
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:16,464
Had she ever
worked here before?

128
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:19,165
No, but not for
want of trying.

129
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:21,568
They all come here
onetime or another.

130
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:24,204
I mean, wouldn't you
rather ply your trade

131
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:27,108
against a soft pillow
than a cold wall?

132
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,144
But I couldn't help her.

133
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,479
No experience.

134
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:32,512
So she was knew to it, then?

135
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:33,948
Oh yes.

136
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,716
Fallen on hard
times, as they say.

137
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,486
She'd been a maid for a
gentleman in a big house.

138
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,754
Very proud of that, she was.

139
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:43,557
Gave me his card as proof.

140
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:47,628
Let's see, I've
got it somewhere.

141
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:54,534
This lady, Polly Neilson, she
was definitely in the trade?

142
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:56,503
I should say so.

143
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,273
Unless she found some other
way of earning a living

144
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:01,975
in a dark alleyway in
the middle of the night.

145
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,144
The girl that found her,
she didn't see anything else,

146
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:06,080
anything suspicious,
somebody running away?

147
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:07,248
Not that she told me.

148
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:09,216
Very well.

149
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:11,951
At least we've got a
name, Polly Neilson.

150
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,086
Not staying for another tea?

151
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,288
Er, no thank you,

152
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:16,757
it's better if I wasn't seen
spending too much time here.

153
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,592
Oh, shame.

154
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:22,562
There's nothing better
than something wet

155
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,831
and warm on a cold
day, Inspector.

156
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,637
As my dear late
husband used to say.

157
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:32,706
I'll see myself out.

158

[suspenseful music]

160
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:19,687
I asked upstairs but the
Inspector's out on his rounds.

161
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,555
Never mind.

162
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:23,957
I'll have more to tell him
by the time he gets back.

00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:52,852
Any news?

165
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:53,687
News?

166
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,822
On the murder.

167
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:56,356
Everyone's asking about it.

168
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:59,659
[gentle tense music]

169
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:05,064
Oh, before you sit down,
sir, that lad from the morgue

170
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:06,366
came looking for you earlier.

171
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,403
Said the Medical
Examiner wanted a word.

172
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:12,706
[gentle tense music]

173
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:18,245
[footsteps approaching]

174
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:23,083
[door knocking]

175
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:26,052
Locque?

176
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:27,654
Ah, Inspector.

177
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:28,956
You got my message, I take it?

178
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:31,992
Er, shame about
the circumstances.

179
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:33,259
Indeed.

180
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,695
Though I can't think of
any other circumstances

181
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:36,096
in which we are
ever likely to meet.

182
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:37,898
A drink some time, perhaps?

183
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,734
Er, no, no thank you, I don't.

184
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:42,703
So what's this
about the young lady?

185
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:43,870
Dodd said something
to my colleague

186
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,938
about an abominable injury?

187
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:46,774
Abdominal.

188
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,075
An abdominal injury.

189
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:49,208
What sort of thing
are we talking about?

190
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,679
Well, it might be better
if you saw it for yourself.

191
00:12:55,782 --> 00:12:57,317
Christ in heaven!

192
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,689
Dodd had it about right.

193
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,961
What would motivate a man
to do something like this?

194
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:10,764
It's not for me to delve
into motives, Inspector.

195
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:13,933
That's your department.

196
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,336
I've never seen
anything like this.

197
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,672
Nor have I.

198
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:30,117
[door closing]

199
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,720
Elizabeth?

200
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:40,427
[footsteps pattering]

201
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,000
[gentle brooding music]

202
00:14:02,182 --> 00:14:05,086
[thunder rumbling]

203
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:11,125
Straight to the
book cabinet, Thomas?

204
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:15,129
I sometimes wonder if you
care more for those books

205
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:16,363
than you do for me?

206
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:20,300
Not at all, I, I just
wanted to return this.

207
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,104
I know you're curious
about my work, Elizabeth,

208
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:26,239
but it really is no
subject for a lady.

209
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:28,041
I was bored.

210
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:30,510
Reading helps to pass the time.

211
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:32,946
Did you know that the
human tongue is made up

212
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:36,517
of eight separate
interwoven muscles?

213
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:38,017
I'm sure there must
be more edifying things

214
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,286
to read about the house.

215
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:41,822
Or things to do?

216
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:46,593
Say what you will, Elizabeth.

217
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:50,898
I'd certainly miss Emily if
we had to do without her.

218
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,399
I'm sure you would.

219
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:53,834
I meant her cooking.

220
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,403
That was an
excellent roast beef.

221
00:14:57,437 --> 00:15:00,072
It was just missing a
glass of good red wine

222
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:01,040
to go along with it.

223
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:05,846
I'll not enter into that
debate with you again, Thomas.

224
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,080
No, I only meant-

225
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,583
- I'll not have any drink in
this house until you've proved

226
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:12,819
you're capable of controlling
your urge to overindulge.

227
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:15,221
That was all a long
time ago, Elizabeth.

228
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:17,825
I told you, I'm
not discussing it.

229
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:20,560
How can I prove I
can control my urges

230
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:23,497
when there's nothing in the
house to bloody-well drink!

231
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,801
[gentle ominous music]

232
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:35,910
Well.

233
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,551
I think you've just
proved the very opposite.

234
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:47,921

[birds chirping]

246
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:54,714
Ah, Stubb.

247
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:57,284
Just been reading your story
in this morning's paper.

248
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:01,120
I do not appreciate my
name being mentioned.

249
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:03,557
Well, you said I could
quote you, Inspector.

250
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:08,528
[chair screeching]

251
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,462
Well?

252
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:10,998
What can I do for you this time?

253
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:16,003
It's more what I can
do for you, Inspector.

254
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,173
What's this?

255
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:21,140
A confession.

256
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:25,645
What are you confessing to?

257
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:26,647
It's not from me!

258
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,985
It's from the
killer of that girl.

259
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:33,119
Where did you get it from?

260
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,391
It was sent to me
personally, via the newspaper.

261
00:18:37,423 --> 00:18:40,527
Probably some disturbed
person's idea of a joke.

262
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,495
Seems authentic
to me, Inspector.

263
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:43,364
Let me see it.

264
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,601
I thought we could come to
some kind of an arrangement.

265
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:48,634
What do you mean?

266
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,740
Well, I've got the
killer's side of the story.

267
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:55,675
I just need the copper's.

268
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,711
I'd make it a big
two-parter, you know,

269
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,579
front page with a
big illustration

270
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:01,815
of the killer
standing over the body

271
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:02,615
with a knife in his hand and-

272
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:05,718
- Just give me
the bloody letter.

273
00:19:05,751 --> 00:19:09,255
[tense suspenseful music]

274
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,064
Red ink, seems like a gimmick.

275
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:18,298
Well, it wouldn't
be the first time

276
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,799
that a killer's been
attracted to the idea

277
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,335
of gaining notoriety
now Inspector, would it?

278
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:25,105
And that would explain
why he send it directly

279
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:27,441
to a newspaper, as
opposed to yourself.

280
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:33,747
Oh, and, er, he's given
himself a little trade name.

281
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,115
"Jack the Ripper".

282
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:40,086
It's good, isn't it?

283
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,588
Better than anything I
could've ever come up with.

284
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:47,427
Oh, and, er, he goes over
everything he did to that girl,

285
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:50,163
in great detail.

286
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,839
This is obscene.

287
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:02,076
If you publish any of
this, you're a damn fool.

288
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:06,579
[tense suspenseful music]

289
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,118
[footsteps approaching]

290
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:17,123
[door knocking]

291
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:20,259
Report on Polly
Neilson, is it ready?

292
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:21,894
Yes, I finished
with her yesterday,

293
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:24,231
the report's been sat
on my desk all night.

294
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:26,365
Just give me the highlights,
I need to check on something.

295
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:28,667
Well, the cause of death,
as you correctly surmised,

296
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:32,139
was two deep cuts to the
throat, one of which completely

297
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:35,909
severed all of the tissue
down to the vertebrae.

298
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,144
That's the spinal
column, Inspector.

299
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:39,579
What about the other injuries?

300
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:41,715
Well, there are
several small stab wounds

301
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:43,250
and two very deep ones,

302
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:46,152
one particularly so leading
to a breach of the bowel.

303
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:47,787
And a very large
concentration of damage

304
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,655
to the interior of the abdomen.

305
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:54,928
When you say the, er, abdomen.

306
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:55,929
Yes?

307
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:57,530
A gentleman has an abdomen,

308
00:20:57,564 --> 00:21:00,432
but a gentleman
doesn't have a, er-

309
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:02,334
- The injuries are
specific to that part

310
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:05,237
of a woman's abdomen
which differentiates

311
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,472
it to that of a gentleman's.

312
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,878
I made fully detailed
notes, in my report.

313
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:14,013
No, leave that here.

314
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,516
I want to keep the details
of this between ourselves

315
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:18,250
at the moment.

316
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:20,187
This type of crime tends to
attract a lot of attention.

317
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,355
I've already had a reporter
in my office this morning.

318
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:23,222
I understand.

319
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,227
Funny thing is
he had this letter,

320
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,261
supposedly from the killer.

321
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:30,864
Yes?

322
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:33,299
Thought it was a lot of
nonsense, a silly practical joke,

323
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,202
but the description of
the injuries was bang on.

324
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:37,938
A lot of people could
have seen the body

325
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:39,306
before you got there.

326
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:40,906
Even the internal wounds?

327
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,342
[door knocking]

328
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,477
Sorry, sir, but it's urgent.

329
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:45,444
What is it?

330
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:47,314
They've found another one.

331
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:48,615
[Rees] Another what?

332
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:49,682
A girl, sir.

333
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:53,787
[ominous music]

334
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:54,954
[birds chirping]

335
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:58,325
Keep a close guard on her
'till the carriage gets here.

336
00:21:58,357 --> 00:21:59,592
I don't want anybody
touching the body

337
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,461
till we get it to
the medical examiner.

338
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,798
Her name was Mary Anne Keates.

339
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:08,268
You seem very well
informed, Stubb.

340
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,336
I just ask around,
Inspector, that's all.

341
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,338
Thought you might have
read it in a letter.

342
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,975
You never know,
Inspector, you never know.

343
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:17,711
But, if I do get another one,

344
00:22:19,912 --> 00:22:21,014
you'll be the first to know.

345
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:22,716
I will?

346
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:27,520
You will, if we can come
to some kind of arrangement.

347
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:31,991
Otherwise, like everyone else,

348
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:34,594
you can read it on the front
page of the Morning Times.

349
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:37,563
[soft piano music]

350
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:43,336
Have a care, Dodd.

351
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:44,471
What's the matter?

352
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:46,372
She's dead, isn't she?

353
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:49,308
She ain't gonna be
complaining about the service.

354
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:54,314
I have to accurately
ascertain the cause of death.

355
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,384
If you throw her from the
trolley and break her neck,

356
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:01,454
how will I know if the damage
was done pre or post-mortem?

357
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:03,856
Yeah, well, the, er,
cause of death's no mystery

358
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,725
with this one.

359
00:23:09,528 --> 00:23:12,798
[gentle ominous music]

360
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:18,437
It's a cut throat once again.

361
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:22,907
Yeah.

362
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:24,076
And the rest.

363
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:25,611
You've already examined her?

364
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:28,581
I had a good look, yeah.

365
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:30,083
When I took her dress off.

366
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,751
So, you're finally taking
an interest in your work?

367
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:33,920
Only the pretty ones.

368
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:37,791
So she's the same
as the previous one?

369
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:38,659
No.

370
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:40,627
She's worse.

371
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:43,096
[gentle ominous music]

372
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:45,798
[door knocking]

373
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:58,377
Miss Levine, please, now.

374
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,720
Not that I don't appreciate
your visits, Edmund,

375
00:24:06,752 --> 00:24:10,723
but you could try to be
a bit more circumspect.

376
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:13,125
Almost knocking the door
down in broad daylight?

377
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,662
This is a very serious matter.

378
00:24:15,694 --> 00:24:18,932
[gentle ominous music]

379
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:38,084
It's become apparent
that the murders

380
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:40,019
have a particular edge to them.

381
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:46,125
The, er, perpetrator seems to
be taking a certain pleasure

382
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,826
in the act of violence.

383
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:50,462
And what light are you
expected me to shed on this?

384
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:52,799
Well it's occurred to
me you might have acquired

385
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:55,502
a substantial knowledge,
over the years,

386
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,438
of the preferences
of a large number

387
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:01,375
of the gentlemen in the area.

388
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:05,412
Do any of your regulars like
to get rough with girls?

389
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:07,413
Hit them, cut them,
that sort of thing?

390
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:08,647
It happens.

391
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:09,749
But they don't stay
regulars very long

392
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:11,518
once I get to hear about it.

393
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,051
To be frank, Inspector,

394
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:15,188
it's far more common
the other way round.

395
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:16,522
The other way round?

396
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,824
Oh yes, there's plenty of them

397
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:20,527
that come here for
a bit of abuse.

398
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,428
Doctors, lawyers, judges.

399
00:25:23,162 --> 00:25:25,432
We've got a special room for it.

400
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:26,500
Would you like to see it?

401
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,437
[gentle ominous music]

402
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,838
[fire roaring]

403
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:46,152
I'm sorry I can't help
you any further, Edmund.

404
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:48,086
You mentioned a
gentleman's card

405
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,488
you were gonna give me.

406
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:52,491
Yes, I'm sure
it's here somewhere.

407
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:59,199
Never mind, I'm
sure it'll show up.

408
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:02,501
There was one other
thing, Inspector.

409
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:05,004
Some awful man came knocking
on the door this morning

410
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:07,841
claiming to be from the
Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.

411
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:12,645
[gentle ominous music]

412
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,215
Accused me of living
off immoral earnings.

413
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:18,218
[Rees] He's not entirely
inaccurate then, is he?

414
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,487
You know this building's
all my dear late husband

415
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,190
left me with to eke out a
living in my autumn years.

416
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:27,759
[water splashing]

417
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,695
Remind me, what
did he die of again?

418
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,532
Misbehavior.

419
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,569
There seems to be
a lot of it about.

420
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:41,608
[gentle ominous music]

421
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:46,646
[bell dinging]
[birds chirping]

422
00:26:49,949 --> 00:26:51,551
Inspector Rees?

423
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,119
Yes.

424
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,653
What can I do for you?

425
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:56,155
I suppose you've seen this?

426
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:58,791
The newspaper?

427
00:26:58,824 --> 00:26:59,826
This!

428
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:01,627
These appalling murders.

429
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,496
Murders?

430
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,198
The newspaper
only mentions one.

431
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,534
I heard from my carriage
driver on the way here

432
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,301
that a second body
had been discovered.

433
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,004
Word travels fast.

434
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:13,539
Yes, a lot faster than you
it would seem, Inspector.

435
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:15,173
Excuse me, sir, may I ask-

436
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:17,110
- Doctor George Lowry.

437
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:19,546
Head of the Whitechapel
Vigilance Committee.

438
00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:23,582
It's simply not good
enough, Inspector.

439
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,854
I've been a resident of
Whitechapel for over 60 years,

440
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,655
man and boy.

441
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,557
Ran a highly regarded
medical practice

442
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,092
until my retirement last year.

443
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:38,163
This used to be a decent,
God-fearing community.

444
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,167
Now look at it.

445
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:44,303
Once can scarce set foot
outside one's own front

446
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:47,240
door without being accosted
by some filthy rag-seller.

447
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:53,078
Or being propositioned by,
well, by the likes of this girl.

448
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:57,250
And as if that wasn't enough,

449
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:02,288
now we have some foreign
butcher committing acts

450
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,255
of such atrocity-

451
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:04,691
- Foreign butcher?

452
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:05,925
Well, wouldn't you
say so, Inspector?

453
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:11,364
I can't imagine a true
Englishman sinking to the level

454
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:13,732
of such depravity.

455
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:18,104
Do your job properly, Inspector,
and I am sure you will find

456
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:23,143
the dark hand of some
Persian or an Oriental

457
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:25,345
is behind all this.

458
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:28,347
Be that as it may, there has
indeed been a second murder.

459
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:31,951
So my next step is to
establish what connects

460
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:33,619
the two events-

461
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:36,655
- Spare me the procedural
recitation, Inspector.

462
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:38,858
The Whitechapel Vigilance
Committee are well-versed

463
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:41,728
in matters of law and order.

464
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,064
Some of our members
are retired judges.

465
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,835
Our patron is none other than
your very own Chief Inspector.

466
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:53,005
Answer me this,

467
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,677
do you have any suspect
in mind for these crimes?

468
00:28:58,743 --> 00:28:59,811
No.

469
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:01,381
Then what the devil are
you doing sat behind a desk

470
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:02,816
talking to me?

471
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:04,884
Get out there, man.

472
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:09,689
Do your job, knock
on some doors.

473
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:11,691
I can list you a dozen streets

474
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:14,394
where you will
find meat vendors,

475
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:18,063
and animal slaughterers,
and tanners.

476
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:22,334
And not one of
them an Englishman.

477
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:25,904
Thank you, Dr Lowry,
that won't be necessary.

478
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:28,708
And if you do nothing else,

479
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,442
can you not, at the very least,

480
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:33,647
put an end to these
frightful newspaper stories?

481
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:35,814
It's bad enough.

482
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:39,184
We have a murderer
on our streets

483
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:42,255
without the gruesome
details being spread far

484
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:44,790
and wide for the general
populace to gossip about.

485
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,928
I will not have the good name

486
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:52,832
of Whitechapel
besmirched any further.

487
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:57,003
Good day to you, inspector.

488
00:29:59,003 --> 00:30:01,774
[door closing]

489
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:10,482
[thunder rumbling]

490
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:11,750
Elizabeth?

491
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:13,787
[Elizabeth] In here.

492
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:17,190
What's all this?

493
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:19,759
I've made your dinner, Thomas.

494
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,293
You have?

495
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,795
What about Emily?

496
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:24,730
Is it such a surprise?

497
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:27,132
I'm perfectly capable, Thomas.

498
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:29,068
Remember when we
were first married?

499
00:30:30,102 --> 00:30:31,871
There were no housemaids then.

500
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:33,840
I remember it well.

501
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:37,844
Wine, that is a surprise.

502
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:41,381
I felt badly about
what I said yesterday.

503
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:45,183
Don't let your meal get cold.

504
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:46,152
Are you not joining me?

505
00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:47,819
I had something earlier.

506
00:30:47,853 --> 00:30:49,722
This is all about you.

507
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,792
I made your favorite.

508
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:54,793
Steak and kidney.

509
00:30:55,894 --> 00:30:59,132
[gentle wistful music]

510
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:09,075
Mmm, it's excellent, Elizabeth.

511
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:22,855
You know, Thomas, wine
isn't the only thing

512
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:24,757
we've gone without
these past years.

513
00:31:27,992 --> 00:31:32,365
Perhaps tonight could be
something of a, a new beginning?

514
00:31:36,902 --> 00:31:39,038
[thunder rumbling]

515
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,307
[gentle wistful music]

516
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:47,145
There, I knew we
could do without.

517
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:48,881
Without what?

518
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:50,048
Without Emily.

519
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,818
Well, for a night, yes.

520
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:52,985
Did you give her the day off?

521
00:31:53,018 --> 00:31:54,788
I gave her every day off.

522
00:31:56,488 --> 00:32:00,092
I told her to seek a new
position with immediate effect.

523
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,193
You did what?

524
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:04,230
Don't make a fuss, Thomas.

525
00:32:04,262 --> 00:32:05,097
Make a fuss?

526
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:08,533
I'm the head of this
household, Elizabeth.

527
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:09,935
You should have consulted me

528
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,536
before making a
decision like that.

529
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:12,471
Head of the household?

530
00:32:12,503 --> 00:32:14,940
But I'm the one who's here
all the time, you're not.

531
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:16,907
No, Elizabeth.

532
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:17,844
I'll not have this.

533
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:21,913
You must find her
and ask her back.

534
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:23,549
With an apology if necessary.

535
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,955
You'd have your own
wife go begging to a maid?

536
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:32,325
Well I'm sure that won't
be necessary, I just-

537
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:35,828
- I wonder which one of us
is more important to you?

538
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:37,864
What's that supposed to mean?

539
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:40,232
You've a wandering
eye, Thomas.

540
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,902
Don't think I haven't noticed.

541
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:44,903
I've never laid
a hand on Emily!

542
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:49,008
I'd know if you had.

543
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:51,577
Believe me.

544
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:56,616
[gentle solemn music]

545
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:57,916
I know you.

546
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:01,220
Perhaps better than you think,

547
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:04,490
[gentle ominous music]

548
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:08,326
remember that.

549
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:11,530

00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,110

[door opening]
[door closing]

552
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,648
Have you seen this?

553
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,285
Stubb's published another
letter from the Ripper.

554
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:08,353
Details of the case
I didn't even know.

555
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:11,724
There's got to be something
we can charge him with.

556
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:13,358
Aiding and abetting, sir?

557
00:34:13,391 --> 00:34:14,559
That's going a bit far.

558
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:16,194
As far as we know at the moment.

559
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:18,965
Our friend Dr Lowry's
not gonna be happy

560
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:21,166
when he sees this, and
he claims to have the ear

561
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,500
of the Chief Inspector.

562
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:23,936
I wouldn't worry, sir.

563
00:34:25,103 --> 00:34:27,372
Chief Inspector's out
of town, family wedding.

564
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:32,010
[gentle somber music]

565
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,360
Come on, Locque,
where are you?

566
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:05,211
[bowl clanking]

567
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:07,012
Inspector?

568
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:08,547
I was just, er-

569
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,715
- We don't leave cadavers
out over night, Inspector.

570
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:12,617
But you do leave
the door unlocked?

571
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:15,655
Not usually.

572
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:19,191
I was running a bit
late this morning.

573
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:22,061
Perhaps it was Dodd,
he has the other key.

574
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,596
What can I do for
you, Inspector?

575
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:25,331
Report on the
second Ripper victim,

576
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:26,164
is it ready yet?

577
00:35:26,197 --> 00:35:27,699
Yes, it's on my desk.

578
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:28,735
I couldn't see it.

579
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:36,174
Never mind, just give
me the highlights.

580
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,377
Are the injuries
the same as before?

581
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:39,577
More or less.

582
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,578
Would you say it's
the same killer?

583
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:41,813
Most definitely.

584
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:45,151
The chances of there being two
different murderers operating

585
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,653
in such a manner at the same
time would be infinitesimal.

586
00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:50,722
Was there anything
missing from the victim?

587
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,291
A kidney.

588
00:35:53,324 --> 00:35:54,559
Completely removed.

589
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:59,130
But you knew that, didn't you?

590
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:00,066
How?

591
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,167
This morning's paper.

592
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,168
That's impossible.

593
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,671
Published another
letter from the Ripper.

594
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:08,074
What was done to the
girl's body in detail.

595
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:11,577
Well that settles it.

596
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:17,682
The letters are real, and
so is Jack the Ripper.

597
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,288
[door opening]

598
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,324
Sorry sir, I thought
you'd wanna know right away.

599
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,092
They've found another body.

600
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:28,327
Looks like our man again.

601
00:36:32,731 --> 00:36:36,235
[gentle foreboding music]

602
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:45,744
Be nice to go just one day
without finding another body.

603
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,218
It's Stubb!

604
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:55,688
I'd like a word with him.

605
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:57,755
[tense dramatic music]

606
00:36:57,789 --> 00:36:59,291
[whistle blowing]

00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:02,494
[tense dramatic music]

00:37:19,777 --> 00:37:23,781
[gentle foreboding music]

609
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:26,251
I imagine you know which
case you've been invited in

610
00:37:26,284 --> 00:37:27,385
to share you knowledge of?

611
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:28,853
Invited to share my knowledge?

612
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:30,856
Yeah well, that's a fine way
to put it, Inspector, isn't it?

613
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,691
I'm learning from you, Stubb.

614
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:33,826
I'm an innocent
man, Inspector.

615
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:35,260
Why did you run?

616
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:37,228
I've not even been
charged with anything.

617
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:39,198
Allow me to remedy
that situation.

618
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,668
Unless you start talking you'll
be charged with the murders

619
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:46,472
of Polly Neilson, Annie
Chaplin and quite possibly

620
00:37:46,505 --> 00:37:47,907
the young girl that
was found this morning.

621
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,175
Murders?

622
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,612
I, I thought you were
gonna charge me with-

623
00:37:53,644 --> 00:37:54,480
- With what?

624
00:37:58,282 --> 00:37:59,717
Nothing.

625
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:01,921
Nothing, I, er, I misspoke.

626
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,624
Why don't you try again?

627
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,161
I don't know nothing
about those murders.

628
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:15,233
On the contrary, Mr Stubb,
you seem to know an awful lot.

629
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:16,601
Rather too much, as it happens.

630
00:38:17,702 --> 00:38:20,239
Intimate, detailed
knowledge of the wounds

631
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:23,442
to each victim's body,
that you didn't get from me

632
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:25,510
or anybody else in
this department.

633
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:27,679
Well those details were
in the letters, Inspector.

634
00:38:27,713 --> 00:38:31,517
Oh yes, the famous
Ripper Letters.

635
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,986
In blood red ink, no less.

636
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:36,421
You said yourself that they
were authentic, Inspector.

637
00:38:36,454 --> 00:38:38,990
I said the information
in them was authentic,

638
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:40,358
not the writer.

639
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:43,761
And it seems to me
that you, Stubb,

640
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:45,731
personally have done rather well

641
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:49,202
out of this whole,
nasty business.

642
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:53,072
Search his bag.

643
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:56,241
You've no right to do that.

644
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:57,677
Something to hide in there?

645
00:38:58,643 --> 00:39:00,346
The murder weapon perhaps?

646
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:02,681
Of course not.

647
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:07,286
Looks like a
packet of notepaper.

648
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:11,088
And an ink pen.

649
00:39:11,123 --> 00:39:13,492
Of course I've got an ink

Scarlet Red.

652
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,545
I wonder, Mr Stubb, if we took
a sample of your handwriting

653
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:36,716
and compared it to one
of these Ripper letters,

654
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,417
what conclusion
we might come to?

655
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:48,360
You got a light?

656
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:50,762
No.

[gentle foreboding music]

658
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:09,414
All right.

659
00:40:09,447 --> 00:40:10,382
I did the letters.

660
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:13,952
It was just a bit of
showmanship, you know?

661
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:17,021
And er, well, I didn't think
it would cause any harm.

662
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:18,089
And the murders?

663
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:19,692
No.

664
00:40:19,724 --> 00:40:21,360
No, I ain't nothing to
do with those murders.

665
00:40:21,393 --> 00:40:24,396
Then how did you know what
to write in those letters?

666
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:27,465
Every knife slash, every cut.

667
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:29,934
Every detail of
those girls' bodies.

668
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:47,820
Well sir, this one's
in a right state.

669
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:50,588
Why does he do it, do you think?

670
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:52,657
It's not for us to divine why.

671
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,427
Yeah but, you must wonder.

672
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:58,797
I mean, everyone's
talking about it,

673
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:00,898
it's all Ripper this
and Ripper that.

674
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:02,534
I have to keep my head down.

675
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:06,904
If anyone knew I'd had my
hands all over his victims...

676
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:10,376
The second victim, do you
know where my report is?

677
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:15,380
It'll be on your
desk, won't it?

678
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:16,749
It isn't.

679
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:18,517
But I'm sure it was last night.

680
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:24,590
You probably took it home.

681
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,659
Now why would I do that?

682
00:41:28,827 --> 00:41:32,464
[dramatic suspenseful music]

683
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:34,866
Are you sure you don't
know where it is?

684
00:41:39,603 --> 00:41:41,973
Put yourself in
my position, Stubb.

685
00:41:43,974 --> 00:41:45,911
I'm under a lot of
pressure to nab somebody

686
00:41:45,943 --> 00:41:50,516
for these murders, thanks
to your bloody newspaper.

687

You're the first to the
scene of every crime,

688

you've got in-depth
knowledge of the killings,

689
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,894
and you, personally
stand to benefit

690
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:05,963
from each and every murder,

691

the more shocking and
perverted the better.

692
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:14,539
Give me one damn reason
why I shouldn't throw you

693
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:16,841
in the cells this very minute?

694

Locque?

696
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,518
I'm in the middle of something!

697
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,152
I know.

698
00:42:27,184 --> 00:42:28,453
That is why I came.

699
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:32,625
Tell him, Dodd.

700
00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:37,528
He got 'em from me.

701
00:42:37,561 --> 00:42:38,596
What?

702
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:43,201
The medical reports
on the bodies.

703
00:42:43,235 --> 00:42:45,838
He's been taking
them from my desk,

704
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:48,773
copying them out and then
returning them the next morning.

705
00:42:49,974 --> 00:42:52,577
And the copies went
to your friend, there,

706
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,078
from the newspaper.

707
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,583
Are you sure of this?

708
00:42:57,615 --> 00:43:00,219
This morning he
forgot to put them back.

[Rees] And I imagine you
paid a pretty penny for them?

It's not a crime to
report the true facts

711
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:06,525
of a case, is it?

712
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:08,527
Why didn't you just
bloody-well say so?

713
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:11,130
I'm a journalist, Inspector.

714
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,499
I have to protect my sources.

715

Still, cheers.

It's worth it, I imagine.

You're not married?

No, never found the time.

It is Thomas, isn't it?

Yes, my work does come first.

I imagine you're
under a lot of pressure.

It's not the
external pressure,

736

it's what's in here, Thomas.

737

I take it personally,
whatever happens on my patch,

738

and whoever the victim is, be
it, lord, lady or gentleman.

They all deserve justice.

from the newspaper conjured up?

It is.

But I've a feeling
it's gonna stick,

746
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:42,954
it seems quite fitting.

747
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:44,056
Not entirely.

Oh?

00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:46,692
What's your take on it, then?

Everything I know
is in my reports.

Yes.

752

I'm not interested
in what you know.

753

I'm interested in
what you think.

I don't follow you?

755

You're more intimately
acquainted with the injuries

756

to these girls'
bodies than anybody.

Anybody but the killer himself.

758

You might have some thoughts,
some suspicions, anything.

759
00:45:10,248 --> 00:45:14,353
I mean, what could make a
man do something like this?

760
00:45:14,385 --> 00:45:16,721
A suspicion doesn't
constitute evidence, Edmund.

761
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,690
I might help.

762
00:45:19,123 --> 00:45:21,059
It might throw some
light on something.

763
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:25,831
For instance, what
weapon is responsible

764
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:27,065
for these injuries?

765
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,400
It's in my report,
a precision blade.

766
00:45:28,432 --> 00:45:30,268
What does that mean?

767
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,103
A butcher's knife?

768
00:45:31,135 --> 00:45:32,371
No.

769
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:35,273
No, no, something much
sharper, more precise.

770
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,907
A craftsman's blade, perhaps.

771
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,010
A surgeon's scalpel.

772
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,713
Possibly, yes.

773
00:45:45,215 --> 00:45:46,652
On the recommendation
of Dr Lowry,

774
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:48,887
we've got people out
interviewing every butcher

775
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,956
and slaughter man
in the district.

776
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:52,657
Are we wasting our time?

777
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,659
I would say so, yes.

778
00:45:54,693 --> 00:45:57,663
The killer's no
butcher, he's precise.

779
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:01,366
And with a knowledge
of the human anatomy.

780
00:46:02,733 --> 00:46:05,403
That missing kidney
was expertly removed.

781
00:46:05,436 --> 00:46:06,771
An educated man?

782
00:46:06,804 --> 00:46:07,772
Almost certainly.

783
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:08,740
A man of means?

784
00:46:08,773 --> 00:46:09,807
Possibly.

785
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,377
So robbery isn't
his motive, then?

786
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:16,347
Without a doubt, his motive
is something much darker.

787
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:23,722
The location and savagery
of the injuries suggest

788
00:46:23,755 --> 00:46:28,059
he takes an abnormal pleasure
in the act of violence.

789
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,132
A prurient pleasure if you like.

790
00:46:38,036 --> 00:46:40,204
There's no shortage of
suspects then, is there?

791
00:46:40,237 --> 00:46:41,205
What do you mean?

792
00:46:44,909 --> 00:46:46,378
It's all around us, Thomas.

793
00:46:48,346 --> 00:46:52,751
In every Penny Dreadful
novel in every corner shop.

794
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:55,788
The more gruesome the murders
the more the public lap it up.

795
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:59,958
Did you know, householders
in the vicinity

796
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,460
of every murder scene are
renting out their upstairs rooms

797
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:04,829
for people desperate
to catch a glimpse

798
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:08,266
of where a Ripper
victim met their demise.

799
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:13,171
I truly believe it's
something buried deep

800
00:47:13,204 --> 00:47:15,106
inside of us, Thomas.

801
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:17,375
This desire for violence.

802
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:18,576
In all of us?

803
00:47:18,608 --> 00:47:21,913
If I could get my hands on
the bastard that's behind this.

804
00:47:24,516 --> 00:47:28,153
What do you think might
release it, this buried desire?

805
00:47:29,853 --> 00:47:32,890
Could be anything,
I mean, drink, lust.

806
00:47:32,923 --> 00:47:36,527
Do you think it's possible
that the killer himself might

807
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:38,797
be unaware of his actions?

808
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:39,465
Unaware?

809
00:47:41,498 --> 00:47:42,399
Of crimes so heinous?

810
00:47:42,434 --> 00:47:44,236
Well, if excessive
drink were involved,

811
00:47:44,268 --> 00:47:46,137
in a drunken state many
a man have committed acts

812
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,072
that they would
normally find abhorrent.

813
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:50,509
Almost sounds as if you're
making excuses for him.

814
00:47:52,277 --> 00:47:54,045
No, no not at all.

815
00:47:54,077 --> 00:47:54,880
Another?

816
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,481
If you don't mind.

817
00:47:56,514 --> 00:47:59,284
[drink burbling]

818
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,257
So, we've established the
type of man we're looking for.

819
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:09,193
An educated man, a
gentleman, quite possibly

820
00:48:09,226 --> 00:48:10,228
some knowledge of surgery.

821
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,896
Yes.

822
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:14,398
What about his truly
defining characteristics?

823
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:15,800
Well, what do you mean?

824
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:18,503
Simply having
access to scalpel

825
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:21,306
doesn't make one a murderer.

826
00:48:22,907 --> 00:48:27,077
I mean, what makes
a man commit acts

827
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,413
of such appalling degeneracy?

828
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:31,916
How can you hope to know
that from the evidence in hand?

829
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:32,917
Think, damn it!

830
00:48:39,623 --> 00:48:43,427
Well, there was one thing
that struck me as odd.

831
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,999
I didn't mention
it in my reports

832
00:48:48,032 --> 00:48:50,202
'cause I wasn't exactly
sure how to phrase it.

833
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:57,475
The way in which the wounds
are inflicted is inconsistent.

834
00:48:59,878 --> 00:49:00,979
So you think there's
more than one of them?

835
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:03,949
No, not between the killings,

836
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:06,985
I mean each one is inconsistent.

837
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:09,588
The initial attacks,
the throat slash

838
00:49:09,621 --> 00:49:11,289
and the abdominal stabbings,

839
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:14,526
it's all done very fast and
with considerable force.

840
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,061
In the heat of
passion, you might say?

841
00:49:16,094 --> 00:49:19,463
You might, yes, but
then the internal wounds,

842
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:24,001
the organ removal,
this was done carefully

843
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:29,007
and with precision, almost as
if by another hand entirely.

844
00:49:30,173 --> 00:49:32,277
So you do think there's
more than one of them?

845
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,210
No, no, no,

846
00:49:33,244 --> 00:49:34,112
I was speaking figuratively.

847
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:37,883
It's clearly the same
blade, I just wondered.

848
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,454
Does this provide any clue as
to the killer's intentions?

849
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,092
The murders are
committed very fast-

850
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,193
- Not just fast, frenzied.

851
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:53,998
Once the victim is dead, a
different motivation takes over

852
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,934
a more careful, planned act.

853
00:49:58,402 --> 00:49:59,237
But why?

854
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,579
To send a message.

855
00:50:10,114 --> 00:50:14,385
To who?

856
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:15,253
To us.

857
00:50:22,726 --> 00:50:23,961

yourself, Edmund.

wouldn't be mad, would he?

young man you were.

975
00:59:12,556 --> 00:59:17,461
And a good deal less innocent
when I left, thanks to you.

976
00:59:22,565 --> 00:59:24,568
Didn't it feel
like love, Edmund?

977
00:59:26,603 --> 00:59:28,071
Just for a moment?

978
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:35,547
Sometimes it still does.

979
00:59:38,782 --> 00:59:40,718
That's just how it should be.

980
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:41,820
When it's done right.

981
00:59:44,088 --> 00:59:45,122
[gentle wistful music]

982
00:59:45,155 --> 00:59:46,557
But all these girls nowadays,

983
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,492
on street corners
and back alleys.

984
00:59:48,525 --> 00:59:50,527
No wonder someone's
turned against them.

985
00:59:52,596 --> 00:59:54,065
I cant help them all, Edmund.

986
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,470
And neither can you, it seems.

987
00:59:59,936 --> 01:00:02,973
This is a difficult case,
the evidence is pointing-

988
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:04,108
- Evidence?

989
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:07,110
I've got some evidence for
you, for what it's worth.

990
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:10,181
What is it?

991
01:00:10,213 --> 01:00:11,548
The gentleman's card.

992
01:00:11,581 --> 01:00:12,349
The one Polly
Neilson worked for,

993
01:00:12,382 --> 01:00:14,151
before she was
out on the street.

994
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:16,686
Bloody hell!

995
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:21,224
[dramatic suspenseful music]

996
01:00:21,257 --> 01:00:23,860
Edmund, about what I said-

997
01:00:23,893 --> 01:00:25,128
- Never mind that!

998
01:00:25,161 --> 01:00:26,497
We've got him!

999
01:00:29,632 --> 01:00:30,268
What?

1000
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:36,072
[dramatic suspenseful music]

1001
01:00:36,106 --> 01:00:37,208
Dr Lowry.

1002
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,041
Inspector?

1003
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:40,211
What is all this?

1004
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:43,713
I suppose there's
been some development

1005
01:00:43,746 --> 01:00:45,081
you wish to report to me?

1006
01:00:45,114 --> 01:00:47,817
There has indeed, sir.

1007
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:49,820
So, you've caught the man?

1008
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:51,021
You have him in custody?

1009
01:00:52,889 --> 01:00:54,759
He is at this very
moment within the walls

1010
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:56,092
of this police station.

1011
01:00:56,126 --> 01:00:57,228
Excellent news!

1012
01:00:58,329 --> 01:01:01,666
And what manner of
man or beast is he?

1013
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,633
Have you questioned him?

1014
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:03,734
I am endeavoring to so.

1015
01:01:03,766 --> 01:01:06,269
Doesn't even speak the
Queen's English, I expect.

1016
01:01:06,302 --> 01:01:11,308
But first sir, I need to
ask what your particular

1017
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,210
interests in this case?

1018
01:01:14,077 --> 01:01:15,278
My interest?

1019
01:01:15,311 --> 01:01:16,813
Well, you've been
extremely forthcoming

1020
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:18,349
in your willingness to assist.

1021
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:22,052
Well naturally, as a
Whitechapel resident,

1022
01:01:22,085 --> 01:01:24,087
and one of the better
ones if I may say,

1023
01:01:25,255 --> 01:01:27,892
I took it upon myself
to strive tirelessly

1024
01:01:27,925 --> 01:01:29,660
until the culprit
was apprehended.

1025
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:32,096
Which has involved, as
you previously stated,

1026
01:01:32,128 --> 01:01:33,697
going from door to door.

1027
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,633
Well I didn't go myself,

1028
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:38,836
I have other things to attend
to, but I organized a group

1029
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:42,173
of similarly concerned
citizens to do so.

1030
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:44,141
Purely as a concerned citizen?

1031
01:01:44,173 --> 01:01:45,275
Yes.

1032
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:48,379
So you don't have personal
connection to this case?

1033
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:49,779
Personal connection?

1034
01:01:49,813 --> 01:01:51,715
I should say not.

1035
01:01:51,748 --> 01:01:52,549
What are you suggesting?

1036
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,751
I'm not suggesting
anything, sir.

1037
01:01:53,784 --> 01:01:55,152
It sounds to me very much

1038
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:57,922
like you are
suggesting something.

1039
01:01:59,856 --> 01:02:02,692
Do you think a man of my
standing would have anything

1040
01:02:02,726 --> 01:02:05,630
to do with the sort of
people involved in this case?

1041
01:02:05,663 --> 01:02:07,298
Or, or any murder,
for that matter?

1042
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:12,402
I must warn you, I'm
a very good friend

1043
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:14,204
of your Chief Inspector.

1044
01:02:15,438 --> 01:02:20,644
Be that as it may, I
need to ask you outright,

1045
01:02:21,411 --> 01:02:24,915
and I require a truthful answer.

1046
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:29,120
Do you have any
personal connection

1047
01:02:29,152 --> 01:02:32,722
to any of the
victims in this case?

1048
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:33,391
No.

1049
01:02:33,423 --> 01:02:36,192
Mary Jane Keates?

1050
01:02:36,226 --> 01:02:37,028
Annie Chaplin?

1051
01:02:37,061 --> 01:02:37,862
No.

1052
01:02:37,894 --> 01:02:38,929
Polly Neilson?

1053
01:02:38,961 --> 01:02:39,797
No!

1054
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:44,768
Can you confirm that
this is your card, sir?

1055
01:02:46,202 --> 01:02:47,103
Yes, of course it is,
it's got my name on, man.

1056
01:02:47,137 --> 01:02:48,339
And where did you get it?

1057
01:02:48,371 --> 01:02:49,572
I got it from a
house of ill-repute,

1058
01:02:49,606 --> 01:02:53,411
where this morning the body of
Catherine Eastwood was found

1059
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:56,380
with her stomach opened
from top to bottom.

1060
01:02:56,413 --> 01:02:58,782
Are you out of
your mind, Inspector?

1061
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,083
Well somebody is!

1062
01:03:00,117 --> 01:03:04,188
[gentle suspenseful music]

1063
01:03:04,221 --> 01:03:09,226
I have never set foot
in that establishment.

1064
01:03:10,393 --> 01:03:11,761
It was left there
by Polly Neilson.

1065
01:03:11,795 --> 01:03:14,731
I told you I
don't know the girl.

1066
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:24,408
I spoke to a few
of her acquaintances

1067
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,176
on the way back here.

1068
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:27,711
It's easy enough to do so,

1069
01:03:28,911 --> 01:03:30,847
there's plenty that knew
her down at the doss house.

1070
01:03:33,382 --> 01:03:36,788
Turns out, "Polly" was a name
she acquired on the streets.

1071
01:03:37,987 --> 01:03:41,692
Her real name was
Mary Anne Neilson.

1072
01:03:45,896 --> 01:03:47,164
Ring a bell does it, sir?

1073
01:03:48,331 --> 01:03:52,802
I do recall a girl
of that name, yes.

1074
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:54,104
Worked for you as a maid.

1075
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:56,007
You have to
understand, Inspector,

1076
01:03:57,173 --> 01:03:59,275
these girls come
and go all the time.

1077
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:00,478
My housekeeper takes
care of it all.

1078
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,880
But you remember
this one, don't you?

1079
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,985
She told her story quite
liberally down at the doss house.

1080
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:09,853
She was stealing, I had
to have her dismissed.

1081
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,856
Dismissed her
personally, I believe?

1082
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,524
Threw her out on her
ear without two pennies

1083
01:04:13,556 --> 01:04:14,924
to rub together.

1084
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:16,360
Is it any wonder she
ended up where she did?

1085
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:17,961
A thief deserves no better.

1086
01:04:17,994 --> 01:04:19,763
How did you know
she was a thief?

1087
01:04:21,398 --> 01:04:24,469
She had taken pieces
of silver cutlery.

1088
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:27,805
Go on.

1089
01:04:29,273 --> 01:04:32,876
She secreted them in her
undergarments, isn't that so?

1090
01:04:34,478 --> 01:04:37,947
Where you found them, in
the course of performing

1091
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:40,885
an indecent act upon her
person, isn't that so Dr Lowry?

1092
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:44,155
Damn you, Inspector, this
is no business of yours!

1093
01:04:44,188 --> 01:04:48,092
And it has nothing to
do with these murders.

1094
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,860
Oh, I think it's got a lot
to do with these murders.

1095
01:04:50,893 --> 01:04:52,529
I think it was entirely
in your interests

1096
01:04:52,563 --> 01:04:56,099
that Mary Anne Neilson should
meet her fate that night.

1097
01:04:56,132 --> 01:04:58,001
I'm sure you told her
to keep her mouth shut

1098
01:04:58,034 --> 01:05:01,004
but there was no way of
making sure, was there?

1099
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:03,840
And having done it once you
acquired a taste for it.

1100
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:08,311
Before you deny it, let
me reveal one other fact.

1101
01:05:08,344 --> 01:05:10,313
According to the expert analysis

1102
01:05:10,347 --> 01:05:13,517
of the Police Medical
Examiner, these murders are not

1103
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:16,854
the work of some butcher
or slaughter man.

1104
01:05:18,222 --> 01:05:20,424
The injuries inflicted
upon these bodies were done

1105
01:05:20,456 --> 01:05:24,561
by the hand of an educated
man with clear knowledge

1106
01:05:24,594 --> 01:05:28,098
of human anatomy, quite possibly
a doctor such as yourself.

1107
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:33,036
And can I also make it plain
that consider your actions

1108
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,506
since the first murder
to be highly suspicious.

1109
01:05:36,873 --> 01:05:39,542
You have shown an unnatural
interest in the case,

1110
01:05:39,576 --> 01:05:41,512
attempting to railroad
the investigation off

1111
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:43,380
in inappropriate directions,

1112
01:05:43,413 --> 01:05:45,849
all the time trying to
shift blame from yourself.

1113
01:05:47,251 --> 01:05:50,588
So, Dr Lowry, I have every
justification in bringing you

1114
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:53,590
in here for questioning, and
the question I would like

1115
01:05:53,623 --> 01:05:58,461
to ask you, is can you
account for your movements

1116
01:05:58,494 --> 01:06:00,998
over the last two nights?

1117
01:06:07,036 --> 01:06:12,042
I think, perhaps, you should
ask your Chief Inspector

1118
01:06:12,643 --> 01:06:13,443
that question.

1119
01:06:15,545 --> 01:06:19,050
The Chief Inspector can
account for my movements.

1120
01:06:20,217 --> 01:06:22,552
Along with around
three dozen members

1121
01:06:22,585 --> 01:06:24,221
of his extended family.

1122
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:30,260
I've been away in Guildford
for the past two days

1123
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:33,998
attending my God
Daughter's wedding.

1124
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:37,534
My God Daughter who also happens

1125
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:42,005
to be the niece of
your Chief Inspector.

1126
01:06:43,673 --> 01:06:47,978
They even had us pose for one
of those wretched photographs.

1127
01:06:50,947 --> 01:06:52,949
I'm sure you can
examine the plates.

1128
01:06:56,353 --> 01:06:59,257
[footsteps fading]

1129
01:07:02,492 --> 01:07:06,898
Don't think for a moment
this ends here, Inspector.

1130
01:07:08,664 --> 01:07:12,235
[gentle suspenseful music]

1131
01:07:22,112 --> 01:07:22,980
Did he confess?

1132
01:07:24,181 --> 01:07:26,117
God in heaven, please
tell me he confessed.

1133
01:07:28,117 --> 01:07:30,621
It wasn't him, airtight alibi.

1134
01:07:30,653 --> 01:07:31,454
But you said...

1135
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:32,288
I know.

1136
01:07:32,322 --> 01:07:33,590
But it had to be him!

1137
01:07:33,623 --> 01:07:35,525
It wasn't him.

1138
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:36,427
Not a chance.

1139
01:07:42,532 --> 01:07:44,936
You shouldn't take things
so personally, Thomas.

1140
01:07:46,003 --> 01:07:47,104
It'll come to no good.

1141
01:07:48,438 --> 01:07:50,273
I've had to learn
that lesson myself.

1142
01:07:53,275 --> 01:07:55,078
Take a holiday.

1143
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,181
The case isn't gonna go
away in your absence.

1144
01:08:02,184 --> 01:08:03,987
I know it's none of my business,

1145
01:08:05,554 --> 01:08:07,090
go easy on the bottle, old man.

1146
01:08:10,027 --> 01:08:11,595
You look like death.

1147
01:08:12,561 --> 01:08:16,032
[gentle wistful music]

1148
01:08:20,503 --> 01:08:21,704

01:08:28,712 --> 01:08:30,047

[thunder rumbling]

1155
01:09:19,662 --> 01:09:21,097
Good evening, Thomas.

1156
01:09:25,601 --> 01:09:27,203
Is something amiss?

1157
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,842
No, I just... um-

1158
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:33,577
- There's a spare
key to that cabinet

1159
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:35,311
in your desk drawer, Thomas.

1160
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:38,048
Perhaps you'd forgotten?

1161
01:09:40,117 --> 01:09:42,153
And I'm not a fool, Thomas.

1162
01:09:46,155 --> 01:09:47,824
Perhaps you'd
forgotten that as well?

1163
01:09:51,862 --> 01:09:53,463
So I'll ask again.

1164
01:09:55,498 --> 01:09:57,233
Is something amiss?

1165
01:09:58,768 --> 01:10:02,172
Just, just this.

1166
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:05,408
Something else from
your desk drawer.

1167
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,445
What's it, what's it doing-

1168
01:10:08,478 --> 01:10:11,181
- I left it where I knew
you'd find it Thomas.

1169
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:13,484
Because I wanted you to know.

1170
01:10:16,185 --> 01:10:17,420
To know what?

1171
01:10:20,724 --> 01:10:22,693
That I know.

1172
01:10:22,725 --> 01:10:25,628
[thunder rumbling]

1173
01:10:29,365 --> 01:10:32,136
I know about the
secret little bottles,

1174
01:10:32,168 --> 01:10:36,206
sewn into pockets and
hidden behind books.

1175
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:37,306
Elizabeth, I...

1176
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:41,345
And I know about the secret
little walks into town.

1177
01:10:43,412 --> 01:10:46,382
The midnight, moonlit walks.

1178
01:10:48,918 --> 01:10:51,287
I know where you go.

1179
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,856
And I know what you do.

1180
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:59,496
I've walked out in your
shadow on many occasions.

1181
01:10:59,529 --> 01:11:03,567
[dramatic foreboding music]

1182
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,237
I'm telling you this, Thomas,

1183
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:11,809
because from now on,
it's going to stop.

1184
01:11:16,746 --> 01:11:19,449
In fact, I've made sure of it.

1185
01:11:22,284 --> 01:11:26,356
At least with regard to
those particular girls.

1186
01:11:28,792 --> 01:11:30,194
[dramatic suspenseful music]

1187
01:11:30,226 --> 01:11:31,228
You won't be seeing
any of them again.

1188
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:36,599
Except, perhaps, at your work.

1189
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:40,704
Dear God, Elizabeth.

1190
01:11:41,604 --> 01:11:42,772
What are you saying?

1191
01:11:42,805 --> 01:11:45,474
The whores got
what they deserved!

1192
01:11:45,507 --> 01:11:48,945
[dramatic foreboding music]

1193
01:11:48,979 --> 01:11:51,248
Abusing their womanhood,

1194
01:11:52,414 --> 01:11:57,220
using it to steal the
husbands of good women!

1195
01:11:59,889 --> 01:12:02,226
You're a weak man, Thomas.

1196
01:12:03,592 --> 01:12:07,230
Easily led from the
straight and narrow path.

1197
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,404
That's why I blame
them, rather than you.

1198
01:12:16,305 --> 01:12:19,242
That's why I had
to do what I did.

1199
01:12:24,546 --> 01:12:26,616
Christ in heaven, Elizabeth.

1200
01:12:28,417 --> 01:12:29,485
You'll hang for this.

1201
01:12:31,854 --> 01:12:32,755
Why should I?

1202
01:12:33,957 --> 01:12:35,993
No one but you or
I will ever know.

1203
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:42,365
And in case you ever think
of sharing this knowledge,

1204
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:47,404
think on this, Thomas, there
is no evidence to connect me

1205
01:12:48,037 --> 01:12:49,472
to these events.

1206
01:12:52,074 --> 01:12:53,344
But as for you-

1207
01:12:55,612 --> 01:12:56,680
- What are you saying?

1208
01:12:57,881 --> 01:13:01,318
If anyone ever asks
me your whereabouts

1209
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:04,255
on certain times or dates, well-

1210
01:13:05,454 --> 01:13:08,826
- There is evidence, somewhere.

1211
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:12,028
Certain organs were removed.

1212
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:16,500
Oh, Thomas, you disappoint me.

1213
01:13:20,737 --> 01:13:22,640
I never blamed you, Thomas,

1214
01:13:24,373 --> 01:13:28,278
but I must admit
a certain pleasure

1215
01:13:29,712 --> 01:13:32,750
in seeing you destroy the
very evidence you speak of.

1216
01:13:35,085 --> 01:13:40,291
And watching you
enjoy every last bite.

[dramatic foreboding music]

1218

It's getting late.

1219
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:00,711
We should head to the bedroom.

1220
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:08,052
Perhaps you can lie
beside me tonight?

1221
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:25,902
[gentle pensive music]

1222
01:14:54,463 --> 01:14:55,931
Morning Thomas.

1223
01:14:55,965 --> 01:14:57,534
I was just on my way out.

1224
01:14:58,501 --> 01:14:59,101
On your rounds?

1225
01:14:59,135 --> 01:14:59,970
No.

1226
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:02,405
Out for good.

1227
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:03,673
Chief Inspector's orders.

1228
01:15:05,507 --> 01:15:06,943
Seems my handling
of the Ripper case

1229
01:15:06,975 --> 01:15:09,380
wasn't as successful
as he would have liked.

1230
01:15:10,747 --> 01:15:11,949
You cant win them all.

1231
01:15:13,983 --> 01:15:14,818
I suppose not.

1232
01:15:16,685 --> 01:15:18,454
Funny thing though,
there hasn't been

1233
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:20,990
another murder for the
last couple of days.

1234
01:15:21,024 --> 01:15:22,126
Perhaps it's all over.

1235
01:15:23,859 --> 01:15:25,461
Perhaps it is.

1236
01:15:25,494 --> 01:15:27,163
[Rees] We can
but hope, anyway.

1237
01:15:28,497 --> 01:15:29,899
You seem to be taking it well.

1238
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:32,802
I thought it was
your life's work,

1239
01:15:32,836 --> 01:15:34,438
bringing justice to Whitechapel?

1240
01:15:36,538 --> 01:15:38,509
I may have been
wrong about that.

1241
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:41,412
I'm sure I was.

1242
01:15:43,746 --> 01:15:46,449
There's more to life
that work, Thomas.

1243
01:15:48,217 --> 01:15:51,488
And whatever else
happens, life goes on.

1244
01:15:52,555 --> 01:15:53,590
Yes.

1245
01:15:56,225 --> 01:15:59,496
Well, the best of luck to you.

1246
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:02,933
I, er, I've got an
appointment to keep.

1247
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,570
You going somewhere, pleasant?

1248
01:16:10,539 --> 01:16:11,475
Just up the road.

I am.

1255
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,826
So, where are we going?

1256
01:17:39,662 --> 01:17:42,231
Somewhere a long
way from here.
